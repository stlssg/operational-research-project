## Truck loading problem:
A vehicle with m compartments transports q different products of various sizes from a source to n different destinations. The operational problem is how to load the compartments of the vehicle so that the replenishment time is maximized for a given route of destinations.

## Folder Descripsion:
1. The report and its editable format are in folder "report".
2. Results in excel and pictures that are presented in the report, are in folder "results".
3. In the main folder, you will see two python files: main.py and main_comparison.py. The main.py will output one of the most basic results from both Gurobi and heuristic method based on the default setting. This just shows that they are working.
4. If you need to checkout the output that are posted in the report, please run main_comparison.py and the result will be automatically generated in folder "results". Note that, this file run at least 20 mins in my PC, so please do it when you are free.
